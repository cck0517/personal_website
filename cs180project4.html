            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In this project, I will start by trying to find homographies between images. These homographies are essential for understanding the geometric relationships between different views of a scene. Then, using these homographies, I will warp images to perform rectification and image stitching. Rectification will make the images appear rectified, while stitching will combine them into a seamless panorama. This process involves complex mathematical transformations and computer vision techniques to create a cohesive final image from multiple input photographs.</p>

                <p>Once we have the homography matrix, we can use it to warp the images to a different space. This can be done using the inverse warping from last project. Specifically, once we have the homography matrix,
                    we can first determine the output shape by transforming the corner points of the image. After we have the output shape, we can do inverse warping and fill in the values from the original image using bilinear interpolation.

            <div class="subsection">
                <p>One fun thing we can do with homography is image rectification, where we can warp the images to some space so that it appears that we are looking directly from above.
                    If we know something would look like a square when we are directly staring it, we can create a square ourself and warp the image into that square using homography.
                    Below is an example of rectifying a picture of a painting.

            <h2>Part 5: Image Stitching</h2>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>Another fun thing homography can achieve is image stiching. When two pictures are taken from the same center of projection, we can use homography to transform the first image to the space of second image.
                    To align the images, we first calculate the shift between image1 undergoes after homography transformation. Then, we apply the same shift to image2 to align the images. Note that the alignment is not perfect, because we
                    calculated our homography transformation using least square, but this error is minor and not noticeable in stiching. 
                </p>
                <p>
                   Simply aligning the image is not enough for a good stiching. We also need a way to smooth out the region where the images overlap. If we naively take the average of the two images, we can see a very clear edge at the overlap region.
                   To fix this, I will be using two band blending, where I first calculate the L2 distance transform of the alpha masks (which pixels are used in the final result), I then use the normalized distance transform of two pictures to perform blending.
                   Specifically, I first find the high frequency and low frequency components of the two images. For high frequency, the pixel where it's distance transform value is greater will be taken between the two images. For low frequency, the distance transform serves as weights
                   for a weighted average of the two images.

                <p>Now that we have a way to stich images together, it is natural to explore ways to automatically do this task.
                    In this section, I will explore and create a system for automatically stiching images into a mosaic. I will present
                    the system and algorithm step by step, and for most of the steps, I will be following the methods described in <a href="https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa24/hw/proj4/Papers/MOPS.pdf">"Multi-Image Matching using Multi-Scale Oriented Patches" by Brown et al.</a>

            <div class="subsection">
                <p>The first step is to find the interest points. To do this, I used a Harris corner detector to find 
                    the Harris corners in the image. What this is basically doing is using the gradients and the second moment matrix
                    to identify the "corners" in the image (place where siginificant change in all directions occur).
                    Below is an example of detected Harris corners on the two balcony images. As we can see, simply calculating
                    the Harris corners give us very dense points, which makes it highly inefficient to help us match features in later
                    steps.

            <h2>Step 2: Adaptive Non-Maximal Suppression (ANMS)</h2>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>Once we have the Harris corners, we need to find a way to select a smaller subset of all 
                    the interest points. A smaller (and better) subset of interest point will improve the efficiency
                    and accuracy for our algorithm. We want our points to 1. have large corner response, 2. evenly distributed
                    in the image (not too clustered). In order to to this, we can use ANMS. The basic idea of ANMS is that
                    each point is assigned a radius, defined to be the distance to the nearest stronger feature point. Mathematically,
                    this is defined as \(r_i = \min_j |x_i - x_j|\) \(\forall x_j : h(x_i) < c_{robust} \cdot h(x_j)\), where \(r_i\) is the radius, \(x_i\) and \(x_j\) are 
                    feature point locations, \(h()\) is the corner response, and \(c_{robust}\) determines how much is "stronger" considered.
                    Once we have all the radii, we can simply select the top K points with the largest radii. This will give us a very
                    nice and evenly distributed set of interest points. Below is an example of applying ANMS with \(c_{robust} = 0.9\)
                    on the balcony images for K = 100 and K = 50.

            <div class="subsection">
                <p> Now we have a good subset of the interest points, we need to extract feature descriptor using the interest points.
                    To avoid aliasing,we first sample larger parches with radius 20 around the interest points (40*40 patches), we then sample with spacing s = 5 at a lower
                    frequency than the one at which the interest points are located. For this part I used axis-aligned features and only one guassian level, and the features
                    are also normalized afterwards. Below is an example of 50 features extracted from the balcony left image.

            <div class="subsection">
                <p>Now that we have the features, we need a way to match them. To do this, we can use nearest neighbor. 
                First we calculate the distance between all pairs of features, then for each feature, we find its nearest neighbor and 
                second nearest neighbor. We use the Lowe's trick (ratio between nearest and second nearest neighbor distance) to determine the best
                matches. The smallest the ratio is (nearest neighbor is much closer than the second nearest), the better the match is. Additionally,
                we can also filter out some outliers if the matching distance is larger than the average of second nearest neighbor distance from all points.
                Below is an example of feature matching performed on the balcony images.

            <h2>Step 5: RANSAC </h2>
            <div class="subsection">
                <p>RANSAC stands for Random Sample Consensus. It is a robust way to estimate homography. RANSAC is used to further filter
                    out outliers/inconsitency in the matches found in the previous step. To perform RANSAC, we randomly sample 4 pairs of points,
                    calculate the exact homography transformation, and apply this transformation to every other pairs to see if they matches. We record
                    the set of points which follows this computed homography (inliers), with a certain threshold. By repeating this process for a 
                    certain number of iterations, and keeping the largest set of inliers, we can use these inliers to estimate the homography transformation.
                    RANSAC is very robust, as outliers that are different from the majority will be excluded. Below is an example of warping performed using 
                    the homography estimated by RANSAC.

                    every data to be correct in order to make meaningful results, we only need the majority of the data to be correct. This also 
                    reminded me of the principle and assumption bitcoins relied on : the majority of computing power is owned by honest people. It is 
                    facsinating to see the robustness of majority.
