                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>In this project I will implement the image quilting algorithm for teture synthesis and transfer described by
                    SIGGRAPH 2001 paper by Efros and Freeman. The goal is to create a larger texture image from a small sample.
                    This has many interestin applications, for example texture transfer, which I will explore later in this project.

                <h3>Randomly sampled Texture</h3>
                <p>To start with, I will implement the most naive way: randomly sample square patches of size patch_size from a Sample
                    to create an output image. Below is an example of this naive implementation. </p>

                <p>Clearly this is not enough. To improve, I will implement an algorithm that places patches that overlaps with previous
                    patches, and the patches will be selected from the sample image with lowest ssd distance at the overlap section. The selction
                    is done with some tolerance tol. Below is an example of this implementation on the same sample image.

                <h3>Texture transfer</h3>
                <p> With the edge artifact removed, we are ready to implement texture transfer. The high level idea is that when we
                    pick on patch from the sample image, we not only consider the similarity between the patch and the overlap region,
                    we also consider the similarity between the patch and the guidance image(the target image). We control the guidance scale
                    with alpha, where the final metric for ssd is defined as the weighted interpolation between guidance ssd and the overlap 
                    ssd. Below are some examples of texture transfer.

                <h2>Bells and Whistles : Iterative Texture Transfer</h2>
                <p> In section 3 of the paper, the authors discussed an iterative texture transfer algorithm, which have been shown significantly
                    improve the quality of the result. The high level idea is to iteratively apply the texture transfer algorithm starting with higher
                    patch sizes, and in each following iteration, decrease the patch size and finetune alpha. When deciding what patches to sample,
                    in addition to calculating the overlap ssd in the overlap region, also take into account the ssd of the sample patch and what has already been there from the last iteration. 
                    The intution behind this is that this is a "coarse to fine" process, where we first fill in the large scale details, and then fill in the small scale details.
                    Below are the results from the iterative texture transfer.

                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>This projects focuses on depth refocusing and aperture adjustment with light field Data. The data 
                    I am using comes from <a href="http://lightfield.stanford.edu/lfs.html">Stanford Light Field Archive</a>
                    This is basically commprised of mmultiple images taken over a regularly space grid.
                    In light field photography, objects at different depths appear differently when viewed from multiple camera positions. 
                    Far objects stay relatively fixed while near objects shift more significantly across the grid of images. By averaging all images without shifts, 
                    far objects remain sharp while near ones become blurry. 
                </p>

                <h3>Depth Refocusing</h3>
                <p> We can use this intersting effect to simulate a change in focus. First we need to pick a center image as reference.
                    Here I used the image (08,08) because the dataset is comprised of 17x17 images.If we shift all images toward the center image,
                    i.e., shift every image by a scalar factor c multiplied by the difference between coordinates of the reference image and images,
                    we can simulate a different focus. Varying c will give us different focus. Below is a gif showing a simulation of 
                    depth refocusing using c from range [-0.5, 0.1], every frame is generated using every image in the dataset for better quality.

                <h3>Aperture Adjustment</h3>
                <p> There is other intersting things we can do with light field data. For example, we can simulate a change in aperture.
                    This is because averaging a large number of images sampled over the grid perpendicular to the optical axis mimics a camera
                    with larger apperture, while using fewer images mimics a smaller aperture. Focusing on the center image (08,08), I used the parameter
                    r to control the simulated aperture. Basically r controls the radisu around the focus image that are used to generate the final image.
                    If r = 1, that means all images within radius 1 (for example, (07,08), (08,08), (09,08), etc.) are used to generate the final image.
                    A larger r means more images are used to generate the final image, simulating a larger aperture. For all aperture, I fixed c to make 
                    the depth of focus roughly at the center of the image. Below is a gif showing the aperture adjustment.

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p> This is a very fun but very inspiring project! This project gave me deeper understanding of how 
                    cameras work, especially how aperture and focus works. The one thing that I found most interesting is that we can actually
                    simulate change in aperture and depth of focus using light field data. To me, this shows the power of taking average, during
                    this course there were always interesting findings when we take average of a large number of samples (like the mean face).
                    To sum up, this is a very fun project and I enjoyed a lot working on it!
