        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This is the final result of processed photos. I have included the execution time (all using image pyramid algorithm for searching),
            displacement vector for r and g under each result (drx represents displacement x for r, and dgx represents the displacemment x for g, same for y.)
            Note that some image here are actually also post processed (the Bell's and Whistles are applied), but the run time written is simply for pyramid search (to avoid confusion)

        <h2>Naive Implementation and Image Pyramid</h2>

        <div class="block">
            <p>I am using the Euclidean Distance as metric, and during alignment (both naive and image pyramid) I try to minimize the Ecuclidean Distances between two image.
                One problem that I met implementing the naive approach is that the border has too much noise and affects the metric calculation badly. The solution I used to deal with this is 
                only calculate the Euclidean distance between pixels that are not on the border area when scoring different displacements.
                I used an iterative approach to implement image pyramid searching for larger photos, where I first iteratively downscale the photo by a factor of two, till the size of image
                reach some threshold, and begin from the most coarse grained image, find the displacement, then use the rough estimate as a starting point to search over a given window for finer-grained images.

        <h2>Bells and Whistles -- Adding edge as a new feature</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                For some images, simply calculating the Euclidean Distance using the raw pixels does not achieve good results. 
                For example, as we can see below, using naive raw pixels is apparently not enough. I added edge as a new feature, 
                extracting the edges of different images and calculating the Euclidean Distance between different edges as a new 
                feature to determine the best displacement. In theory, I can use edges + raw pixels to score displacement, but in practice, 
                I found only using edge is good enough. Another thing to mention is that calculating edge difference takes significantly more 
                time than the raw pixels, but implementing it with a similar image pyramid algorithm greatly improves speed. On the right are the 
                results of alignment using edge as a bonus feature.

        <h2>Bells and Whistles -- Automatic White Balancing</h2>
        
        
        
        
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                Even though now images can perfectly align, the color still looks off. I have implemented an automatic white balancing function to 
                adjust the color. I used the sad "world averages as grey" assumption, and my implementation is inspired by https://pippin.gimp.org/image-processing/chapter-automaticadjustments.html
                The basic idea of the implementation is to normalize the color plates toward "grey value", which is roughly 128 in unit8 space. I performed a linear shift to the let the mean value of pixels toward This
                grey value, and the magnitude for each individual pixel is proportional to the pixel value and how far the mean value of the whole image is away from the grey value.
                The results are appended below. We can see after automatic white balancing the color looks more "real".

        <h2>Bells and Whistles -- Automatic Contrasting</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <p>
                After white balancing, the color looks a lot better. However, for some images it seems a little bit too "bright". I have tried to finetune the brightness, but it did not work.
                Instead, I implemented automatic contrasting to finetune the contrast of images, so that the color looks more vivid. The way I implemented automatic contrasting is by using the 
                cv2 equliaze histogram function. It helps to spread the pixel values better on the range.
